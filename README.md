The frontend of Smart Spend is built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a clean and responsive design. For secure access, the application incorporates token-based authentication, allowing users to safely interact with their data. On the backend, **Express.js** and **SQLite** work together to handle data efficiently, providing a reliable and smooth experience.
